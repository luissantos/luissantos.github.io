What makes Java so great is not the language itself but the platform where it runs. The JVM is an amazing piece of software and can easily out perform platforms like C++ or GO.

The optimizations done by the JVM allows the developer to write very high level, idiomatic code that runs as fast as C/C++.

These talks show how far the JVM can go to optimize the code and busts some of the most common myths about OO Programming, specially JAVA, like:

- Object creation is expensive
- getters and setters are expensive
